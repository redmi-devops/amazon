He is the first reviewer of Arjun Suravaram and his high praises
boosted our confidence , Nikhil said.

Adding further, Nikhil said a few external factors forced them to change
the title from 'Mudra' to 'Arjun Suravaram'. 

The core plot of the film is very relatable and it hit me really hard. 
It predominantly deals with a social issue. 
We portrayed the severity of the issue and also gave a fitting solution to it," Nikhil added.

'Arjun Suravaram' is based on real incidents.
The lead pair, Nikhil and Lavanya will be seen as journalists in the film. TN Santhosh directed it
